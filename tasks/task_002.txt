# Priority: high
# Description: Create a new git branch and ensure current tests pass before beginning updates
# Details:
Create a new git branch named 'angular-update-18.2.9' from the main branch. Run the full test suite to establish a baseline of passing tests. Back up critical configuration files including angular.json, tsconfig.json, and package.json. Set up a rollback plan in case of major issues.

# Test Strategy:
Verify all current tests pass with the existing version. Document test results for comparison after updates. Ensure git branch is properly created and configuration backups are complete.
