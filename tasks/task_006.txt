# Title: Update RxJS and Related Libraries
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 5
# Priority: medium
# Description: Update RxJS and reactive programming related dependencies
# Details:
Update RxJS using `ng update rxjs@latest`. Review RxJS breaking changes documentation and update code accordingly. Update any libraries that depend on RxJS. Pay special attention to deprecated operators and patterns, replacing them with recommended alternatives.

# Test Strategy:
Run tests for components that heavily use observables and reactive patterns. Verify that all observable subscriptions work correctly. Check for memory leaks using appropriate dev tools.
