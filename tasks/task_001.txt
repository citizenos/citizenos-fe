# Task ID: 1
# Title: Current State Assessment and Dependency Analysis
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: None
# Priority: high
# Description: Document current Angular version and dependencies, run analysis to identify update requirements
# Details:
Document Angular version 18.1.2 and all key dependencies in package.json. Run `ng update --all --dry-run` to identify recommended updates. Create a dependency graph to distinguish direct vs. transitive dependencies. Identify any deprecated packages and note peer dependency requirements that might cause conflicts during updates.

# Test Strategy:
Create a comprehensive report documenting current versions, update recommendations, and potential issues. Verify accuracy by cross-checking with package.json and npm outdated command.
